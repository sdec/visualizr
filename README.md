Visualizr
=========

Visualizes audio frecuency data using EaselJS, SoundJS , PreloadJS (modules of the CreateJS library) and jQuery. 
Relatively large audio files are loaded on the client side, so a beefy computer is required. For this reason, 
Visualizr will not work on mobile.

Visualizr comes with a webserver (mongoose). Simply start the webserver in the same folder, right-click the mongoose icon and click "open browser" to start.
